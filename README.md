# Motion-Detection-in-Video
The analysis of video data has received significant research attention in numerous applications, such as video surveillance, activity recognition, event detection. A fundamental initial step in video processing is the analysis of the motion present in it, detected as changes in its frames illumination. The large size of this data and the wide range of detectable events or objects render the automation of various video processing procedures necessary. The proposed system first finds the pixels where activities occur by processing the higher order statistics of luminance changes between accumulated video frames. Once these pixels are extracted, sequential likelihood ratio based change detection techniques are applied to find at which frames activities occur.
